# ðŸ§© Module 2: Guessing Game Using `input()` and `print()`

## ðŸŽ¯ Why This Module Matters  
- Introduces user interaction using the `input()` function  
- Builds on the previous module by making the game dynamic  
- Helps students understand basic interactivity in programs  
- Encourages trial-and-error learning with text-based games

## ðŸš€ Whatâ€™s New in This Module  
- Adds real-time user input using the `input()` function  
- Students can now enter guesses instead of simulating them with `print()`  
- Begins introducing the concept of program flow based on user interaction

## ðŸ§  Key Concepts Introduced  
- **`input()`**: A built-in function used to capture text input from the user  
- **User Interaction**: Basic communication between the user and the program  
- **Static Logic Flow**: Though no conditions are used, the structure suggests how the game might behave dynamically
